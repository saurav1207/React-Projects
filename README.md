### Our carousel should allow the user to click the backwards or forwards button to go to the previous or next image.

### The images will be stored in a simple array. We will see how to use state in order to store the current image. Then we will update that state to go to the previous or next image, according to the button the user pressed.

### If the user has gone through all of the images, then it starts at the beginning of the array to allow them to cycle through the images again.
